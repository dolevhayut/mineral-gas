description:# Project Context Rules

## Current Project
- **Type**: Simple gas balloon ordering system (מערכת הזמנות פשוטה לבלוני גז)
- **Purpose**: Ordering system for gas balloons

## Original Source
- **Type**: Complex bakery ordering system (מערכת הזמנות מאפייה יחסית מורכבת)
- **Status**: This repository was cloned/copied from the original bakery system
- **Adaptation**: The system has been adapted from bakery orders to gas balloon orders

## Important Notes
- The codebase may still contain references to the original bakery system
- Some terminology, images, and functionality may need to be updated to reflect the gas balloon context
- When making changes, consider whether bakery-specific elements should be adapted for gas balloon orders

## Development Guidelines
- Always consider the gas balloon context when making changes
- Update any remaining bakery references to gas balloon terminology
- Ensure product images and descriptions match the gas balloon business
- Maintain the simplified nature of the current system compared to the original complex bakery system
